# Creating-a-format-to-post-the-day-and-time
This is an exercise provided by w3resource.com. I tried to use only the knowledge I had available, so I'm sure this code could be a lot shorter. It was a nice introduction to Date and some of its methods!

What the project does/Proposed problem: Posts the day and time in a specificied format
Proposed problem: "The day is: DAY.
Current time is: XX AM/PM : XX : XX"
Why the project is useful: Helpful exercise, with what I hope is a thorough explanation
It doesn't have much use outside of showing a possible solution to the proposed problem, but I'm proud of it!
P.S. I currently have no knowledge of how one would keep refreshing the date real-time, so this applies to only a specific instance in time.
