# Creating-a-format-to-post-the-day-and-time
This is an exercise provided by w3resource.com. I tried to use only the knowledge I had available, so I'm sure this code could be a lot shorter. It was a nice introduction to Date and some of its methods!

What the project does/Proposed problem: Posts the day and time in a specificied format

Proposed problem: "The day is: DAY.  
Current time is: XX AM/PM : XX : XX"

Why the project is useful: Helpful exercise, with what I hope is a thorough explanation

It doesn't have much use outside of showing a possible solution to the proposed problem, but I'm proud of it!

P.S. I currently have no knowledge of how one would keep refreshing the date real-time, so this applies to only a specific instance in time.

Solution explained:

Create dayAndTime

There’s a lot going on here. So we’re going to break it down nice and easy. Note that the following focuses more on the `rightNow` variable rather than the noonNow variable (which is a user-defined Date, versus one created at the moment in time like rightNow), but most of the same logic can be used.

The variable rightNow is defined as a new Date constructor, which prints the current date and time. If we called rightNow, we would get the time I made this example, which was Mon Jan 28 2019 17:05:59 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time). Note that this is not a string. So, we make a var timeString to convert it into a string, which returns "16:30:39 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)", which is a string. From there, we make var minSec by concatenating a bunch of space strings with uses of string.slice() to cut out colons and numbers from the timeString, since we want spaces between colons and numbers returned. We get var hour by using .substring() to make a small string made up of the first two characters from timeString. Finally, we make var day by taking the original rightNow variable (remember, not a string), and subject it to the Date.getDay() method, which will return a 1, since Monday = 1 via .getDay()’s rules. 

Since we don’t want military time, if hour is >12, we subtract 12 from it and then add “ PM”. If hour is exactly 12, we just add “ PM” to it. If it’s <12, we add “ AM” to it. 

After this, we make use of a switch statement, whose cases depending on what day is going to equal. Since day = 1, we make day become “Monday”.

Finally, we return a template literal that utilizes the value of day, hour, and minSec.
